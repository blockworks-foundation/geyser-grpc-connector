## Solana Geyser gRPC Multiplexing and Reconnect
This project provides multiplexing of multiple [Yellowstone gRPC](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc) subscriptions based on _Fastest Wins Strategy_.

* Multiple _Futures_ get **merged** where the first next block that arrives will be emitted.
* No __guarantees__ are made about if the messages are continuous or not.
* __Reconnects__ are handled transparently inside the _Futures_.

Disclaimer: The library is designed with the needs of
[LiteRPC](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/lite-rpc) in mind
yet might be useful for other projects as well.

The implementation is based on _Rust Futures_.

Please open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions ->  [New Issue](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/geyser-grpc-connector/issues/new).

## Versions
These are the currently maintained versions of the library

| Tag (geyser-grpc-connector)            | Yellowstone | Solana  | Branch                           |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| 0.10.x+yellowstone.1.13+solana.1.17.28 | 1.13        | 1.17.28 | release/v0.10.x+yellowstone.1.13 |
| 0.10.x+yellowstone.1.12+solana.1.17.15 | 1.12        | 1.17.15 | main                             |
| 0.10.x+yellowstone.1.15+solana.1.18    | 1.15        | 1.18.x  | release/v0.10.x+yellowstone.1.15 |

* note: Version 1.15 of Yellowstone can replace previous versions of Yellowstone as it is backwards compatible and does not pin the Solana version. (tracked [here](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/geyser-grpc-connector/issues/12))
## Installation and Usage

```cargo add geyser-grpc-connector ```


An example how to use the library is provided in `stream_blocks_mainnet.rs`.

## Known issues
* Library does not support other data than Blocks/Slots very well.
* Should not be used with commitment level __PROCESSED__ because slot numbers are not monotoic.
* Library needs messages to be in order and provide slot information to work properly.
